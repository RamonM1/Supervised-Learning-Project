# Financial Fraud Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for fraud detection on a large transaction dataset. The dataset contains more than 6,000,000 rows with a mixture of discrete and indiscrete variables. We will take a look at this dataset to see which strategies we can take in order to successfully capture as many fradulent transactions as possible while also minimizing false positives.

## Observations
For this large dataset I was forced to sample a fraction of it (500,000). I then proceeded to remove erroneous data clomuns that provided to no significant value or information for my analysis.
